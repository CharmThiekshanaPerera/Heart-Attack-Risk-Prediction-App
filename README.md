# Heart Attack Risk Prediction App

This is a **Heart Attack Risk Prediction App** built using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn. The app predicts the risk of a heart attack based on user-provided health metrics such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

## Overview

The app uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on a dataset containing health and lifestyle factors to predict the risk of a heart attack. The model is deployed as a web application using **Flask**, allowing users to input their health metrics and receive a prediction.

---

## Features

- **Input Form**: Users can input health metrics such as age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, and more.
- **Prediction**: The app predicts whether the user is at **High Risk** or **Low Risk** of a heart attack.
- **Scalable**: The app can be deployed locally or on a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-attack-risk-prediction-app.git
   cd heart-attack-risk-prediction-app
Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Dataset:

Place the dataset (heart_attack_data.csv) in the project folder.

Usage
1. Train the Model
Run the train_model.py script to preprocess the data, train the model, and save the model, feature names, and scaler:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py
2. Run the Flask App
Start the Flask app:

bash
Copy
python app.py
3. Access the App
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Enter the required health metrics and click Predict Risk.
